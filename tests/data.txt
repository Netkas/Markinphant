virgo i need advice
hey patrick my sweet homie
hit me, baby, what's up
im getting my birth control out tomorrow, how do i be a good mom, how the fuck do you take care of an infant
omg are you trying for a baby???
You all need love
yes maam
i figure if black people can somehow raise them to an age where they can be shot by other apes, i have a chance at not being awful ,right
ethan ralph has yet to kill his, surely its not *that* hard to not break it
don't worry about what a "good mom" is, just meet your baby's needs and your own as much as you can. sometimes you won't understand why the fuck your baby is cryin and that's ok. babies need love, you can never spoil a baby. give them love, attention, read up on child development. i have an entire parenting course i can give you for when your child is older.
my head hurts a lot
help me üò¢
take care of your sick husband
im going to cry you are the best mommy virgo
having your first baby is rough, you think that letting them cry for 5 seconds while you're taking a shower will turn them into a serial killer, but it's ok
im so fuckin scared
hey, don't be
being a mother is fucking beautiful. exhausting, but beautiful. it's worth it.
bc its a dream of mine but ive freaked out about becoming pregnant for so long its ingrained i should be scared lol
your thoughts create your reality, honey!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
now if only i could get him to like the names i like and somehow god willing i have a boy üòî
prepare as much as you can by spending time with other new mums. do your research, take notes, but most importantly just enjoy your pregnancy because you won't get that time back.
I am thinking about winning the lotto
Whaddaya want me to do?? Feed you peppers?? ‚ù§Ô∏è
your partner will be third in importance in the home and he will need to catch up with housework and looking after you because looking after a baby is full time work.
how hard is it when you only have a dad for your support system vs close family helping
If it's a boy you should name him Kronist.
bc idk if my parents will be around
the tables have turned
I don't even like peppers üò≠
i like the name travis and he likes the name matt üòî war in my house rn
my son's dad burnt out quickly and he was useless but he is aspergers lol
oh jeez
Kiwifarms Mom Hour
i think it's important that you each have time alone and time with baby, and find a play group etc
man i didnt even think baout it my kid is 100% cursed to be autistic
ew i have to make friends???
Compromise: Mattis. Tratt.
mattis kinda slaps
yes, because you are going to have a baby attached to you as a newborn, and you need someone to take your baby so you can just be yourself for 15 minutes without being mum
MATIs
Mattis ain't bad at all
Tramatis
That can be the inside joke
@hayhayluxray if i move in next door do u want to be friends
Never fuse Miltank and Nidoqueen.
??????????
i personally found the transition to mum very fucking hard because i didn't have time for what i usually do that makes me feel happy, and i needed more time alone than i got
Yes ‚ù§Ô∏è best friends
but you will never get those newborn days, weeks, months back
thats how ill prob be with being chronically online since elementary
dope
you birth it
you name it
the mother gets the final say
Till you have another one. Lol
yeah you will have to prepare for that, start making parent friends now
I'm thinking about making cheesy chicken surprise.
you will not regret it if you don't have any family support
well he wants the middle name for family tradition so i may threaten him
also start getting baby stuff NOW
Nah. Both partners should have a chance to name. Hence two kids
diarrhea
That sounds scary. Anything with ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù in the name
i wanted the baby so my ex got to name him lol
i can help you with planning and enjoying your pregnancy miri
This. Inflation is a bitch. Diapers are expensive
i didn't get to enjoy shit
we are moving soon, im not pregnant yet, i get unsterilized tomorrow
The surprise is the diarrhea the next day.
you heard me, get baby stuff now
i love u mommy virgo
your baby needs 3 layers as a newborn of onesies
üòî o-okay
if they do a liquid shit that's three onesies out of action
We need a kf gender reveal disaster
and they will do liquid shits multiple times in a day
I got a really pretty girl name for my future daughter
and I got some ideas for a boy as well
Meadle any advice for potentially new mommy miri
my son is four and i miss those baby days, man
if you feed baby steak with his poops solidify?
